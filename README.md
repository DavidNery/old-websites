This repository contains some sites I made.

It (maybe) will never receive new commits, but many things can be learned or explored with the files in this repository.

You can see screenshots of each site in **{folder}/.github** folder

**Remembering:** try to understand what is happening in the code and be aware of bugs, because, as I said at the beginning of this README, these are sites I made when I was new to web development.
